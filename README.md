# My Toy VM

## Introduction

This is a programming project started at April 22th 2022. The toy programming language in this project is called Xue, which only consists  of simple control flow structure and arithmetical operation. The syntax of Xue is pretty like Assembly Language.

The whole design documentation will be placed in docs/, including the syntax of Xue, the binary format of Xue bytecode and the standard library that a simpliest Xue program must import.

## Origin

The Xue language is named after the last name of my cute girlfriend, which means that she is my new motivation to programming.

## Goal

The goal of this project is very simple, just complete a virtual stack machine, design a toy programming language and run the program written in it on the virtual machine.

Since there's no optimization on the bytecode compiler and the virtual machine, the speed of execution could be very slow. If my girlfriend shows great interest on this project, maybe I would use some optimization techniques to improve the performance.
